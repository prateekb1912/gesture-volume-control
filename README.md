# VOLUME CONTROL WITH GESTURES

A simple Python CV project which lets the user turn the Windows volume up or down with their hand gestures. This project makes use of the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for necessary functions.

## How this works ?

Simple. Just run the program, and wait till the webcam gets activated and then place your hands in front of the webcam to let the program detect your hands. Then, you can control your Windows volume by moving your index finger and thumb closer or farther apart as you like. 

This works for One hand only, so if you want to switch hands, move your hand out of the frame and bring the other hand and have fun!
